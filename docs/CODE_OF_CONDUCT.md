# Contributor code of conduct

## Our pledge

We want to foster an open and welcoming environment. So we (all contributors, including the service manual team) pledge to make the experience of contributing to our community harassment-free for everyone, regardless of ability, age, body size, disability, education, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity and orientation, or socio-economic status.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

* using welcoming and inclusive language
* being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* focusing on what is best for the community
* showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

* using sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* public or private harassment
* publishing other people's private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our responsibilities

The service manual team is responsible for making the standards of acceptable behaviour clear. They will take appropriate and fair action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

The team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not in line with this code of conduct. They also have the right to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviour that they believe is inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This code of conduct applies in project spaces.

It also applies in public when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a service manual project or community include: 

* using the service manual or another official e-mail address
* posting on behalf of the service manual team on a social media or Slack account
* acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event

The service manual team may define or clarify further what representation of a project means.

## Enforcement

You can report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour to the service manual team at [service-manual@nhs.net](mailto:service-manual@nhs.net). 

The team will review and investigate all complaints and will take whatever action they think necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 

The team will keep information about the person who reports the incident confidential. 

They may also post more details about specific enforcement policies separately.

If any members of the service manual team don't follow the code of conduct, you can ask senior staff at NHS.UK to take action.
