# How you can contribute

## Propose a new thing

Anyone can propose a new thing for the NHS digital service manual.

### Check the backlog

- Check if your idea is already in the community backlog.

### If the idea has been proposed

- Please add any examples of evidence you have to support the proposal.
- If you'd like to work on it, read [how to work on a new component or pattern](#work-on-a-new-thing).

### If your idea is not in the backlog

- You can [raise an issue using the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

- At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of user needs.
- The service manual taem will review your proposal, and see if it meets the [contribution criteria](CRITERIA.md).
- Once the proposal is ready to be worked on, it will be marked as "To do" in the backlog.
- You can then choose to [work on it yourself](#work-on-a-new-thing), or leave it for someone else.

## Work on a new thing

### 1. Sign up to work on a thing in the backlog

- Anyone can work on items marked as "To do" in the community backlog.
- If you see something you'd like to work on, email the team at [service-manual@nhs.net](mailto:service-manual@nhs.net).
- If you have an idea for something that's not in the backlog, you can [propose it](#propose-a-new-thing).

### 2. Plan your work with the service manual team

- After you've emailed them, a member of the team will get in touch to arrange a kick-off chat.
- The team will help you scope and plan your contribution. You'll also be able to discuss any support you might need.
- If you're happy to go ahead, the team will assign the issue to you in the backlog.

### 3. Research and develop your contribution

- While you're working on your contribution, you can contact the [service manual team](mailto:service-manual@nhs.net) if you need any help.

### 4. Send your contribution for review

- All work must meet the [contribution criteria](CRITERIA.md) before it can be published. The service manual team will use the criteria to review your contribution.
- To arrange a review, tell the team your contribution is ready.
- If there's anything else to do, the team will share some recommendations.
- If the work is ready to be published, the service manual team will help you get it live.
