# NHS digital service manual criteria

Contributions to the NHS digital service manual need to meet these criteria.

<br>

## New proposals

You need to show that the new thing will be useful and unique.

| Criteria | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| Useful   | You have evidence that it would be useful for many NHS digital teams or services.|
| Unique   | We don't have something similar already.|

The service manual team will look at proposals in the community backlog to check that they meet these criteria before moving them to the "To do" column.

## Criteria for publishing a new thing
### Components and patterns

We need to make sure the implemention is usable, consistent and versatile.

| Criteria     | Description |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| Usable       | It has been tested in user research and shown to work with a representative sample of users, including people with disabilities.|
| Consistent   | It reuses [existing styles and components](https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns) where relevant. It follows the [content style guide](https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content) and [NHS.UK frontend library](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/contributing/coding-standards.md).|
| Versatile    | The implementation is versatile enough to be used in a range of different services. The component or pattern must also work with a range of browsers, assistive technologies and devices.|

The service manual team will use these criteria to decide if the contribution is ready to publish.
