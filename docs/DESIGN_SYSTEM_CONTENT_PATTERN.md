All design patterns and components in the NHS service manual should follow the below content pattern. If you’re working on a pattern or component page for the design system, you should use this as a template. 

(Don’t edit, copy and paste the content into a new doc)

# Title

[Overview]

Use this overview section to:

- explain, in one line, how the component/pattern helps users
- show a live example - if this is not possible because the component/pattern is bigger than one screen (eg Confirm an email address), you can use an appropriate illustration or screenshot and/or link to a prototyped example.

## When to use [component/pattern]

Describe when to use this component/pattern. When is it appropriate to use and what need does it help you meet?

If necessary, include an additional H2 titled ‘When not to use [component/pattern]’. Use this section to highlight any exceptions or known scenarios where the pattern does not work. If you include this section, explain what to use instead (with a relevant link if we’re suggesting an alternative pattern or component).

## How to use [component/pattern]

Use this section to explain how the pattern works. 

This should include:

- (if the component/pattern is too complex to have been fully described in the overview) a full description of how the pattern works (for users)
- rules/instructions on how to implement it
- steps to follow

It can also include:

- coded examples
- things to avoid
- why it works

If this section is quite long, break it into smaller sections with H3s.

### Accessibility

Use this section to summarise the accessibility considerations for this component or pattern.

## Research

Use this section to summarise the research that supports this component or pattern.

Describe:

the research context, for example, whether it was tested in isolation, or as part of a prototype or a live service 
types of users tested with, for example, users with disabilities, users with low digital literacy

If possible, finish this section with a link to more detailed research notes. It must be documented somewhere that’s open and publicly-accessible, ideally a blog post. 

### Known issues and gaps

Use this section to describe any known issues with the component or pattern, or any gaps in the research. 

### Next steps

If applicable, include this section and use it describe outstanding research or work to be done or questions to answer.
