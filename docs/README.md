# NHS digital service manual community backlog

This is a place for digital teams in the NHS to work together and develop the [NHS digital service manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk). 

## Working in the open

The community backlog lives on GitHub, in the open where everyone can see and get involved. Weâ€™ve grouped the backlog into 3 areas:

[Design system (components and patterns) backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/1)

[Content style guide backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/2)

[Practices and ways of working backlog](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/projects/3)

## Working together

Join in with the community. It gives you a great chance to:

- **collaborate** on developing great solutions to common design problems
- **share** your hard work, insights and learnings with others
- **get help** with your own design and development challenges

## Ways to contribute

Anyone can contribute to the community backlog. All you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to get started. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these templates:

- [Ask a question](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%E2%9D%93&template=question.md&title=)
- [Report an issue](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)
- [Propose a new idea](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=new-feature.md&title=)

To feedback or share insights on something that already exists:

1. Find the issue in the community backlog - either in the [issues list](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues) or on the [project boards](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects)
2. Add a comment to that issue

Regardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue or feedback as early as possible in the process.

## Maintaining the backlog

The community backlog is maintained by [the service manual team](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/service-manual-team) who label, close, and manage all GitHub issues.
