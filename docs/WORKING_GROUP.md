# Standards working group

The Standards working group is a multi-disciplinary panel of representatives from across the NHS. It makes sure that all components and patterns published in the NHS.UK digital service manual are of a high quality and meet user needs.

The working group reviews proposals and contributions against the [contribution criteria](CRITERIA.md)
makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work
advocates for the needs of colleagues across the NHS.

## Why the working group exists
By including representatives from a mixture of disciplines and departments, the working group helps to ensure that the Standards represents its users.

It means that decisions made are fair and unbiased, and that the Standards reflects the experiences of the whole of the NHS not just one department. 

## How to join the working group

The Standards team is looking into the best way of helping people to join the working group.
